## Abstract

This chapter explores a learner-centred assessment practice that was developed and first implemented in 2020, during the COVID pandemic. The innovation featured in this chapter thus takes advantage of the affordances of teaching remotely, however, it does not depend upon a remote context. The assessment was also implemented in a context that utilized videogames as a teaching tool, and thus the term ‚Äúpro-gamer inspired‚Äù refers to the activity in which gamers often engage: the creation of montage videos to showcase their best gameplay achievements. In this way, and with a focus on educational practice, the assessment method aligns closely with portfolio creation which is then assessed by instructors. In the case of this chapter, students created a portfolio of their best English language performances in alignment with a predefined rubric.
