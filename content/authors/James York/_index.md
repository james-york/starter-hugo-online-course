## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Iâ€™m James York.

__My hashtags__: #games #pedagogy #taiko #petscii #techno

I conduct research on the application of games and play in education, particularly literacy teaching contexts. 

I also edit [Ludic Language Pedagogy](https://llpjournal.org/), an open-access journal which publishes research on the integration of games and play into language teaching practices.
