---

## 1. Introduction

- A philosophical work that explores the nature of games, 
  - their relationship with work, 
  - and what it means to play a game. 
- Published in 1978, the book is widely regarded as a classic in the philosophy of games.

---

## 2. Overview

- a theory of games that emphasizes the concept of "the **lusory attitude**." 
- playing a game involves adopting a special attitude towards the activity where the goal is to enjoy the process of playing, rather than achieving any external goal.

---

## 3. The Lusory Attitude

- The key concept in Suits' theory of games. 
- It is the attitude of accepting the arbitrary limitations imposed by the rules of a game and the willingness to play within those limitations. 
- The lusory attitude involves a willingness to play by the rules and to accept the game's goals as valuable in themselves.

---

## 4: Games and Work
- One of the main arguments of 'The Grasshopper' is that games and work are fundamentally different activities. 
- Whereas work is done for the sake of some external goal, games are done for their own sake. 
- Suits argues that games are a valuable form of human activity precisely because they allow us to pursue goals that are valuable in themselves, rather than merely instrumental.

--- 

## 5: The Nature of Games
- Suits offers a definition of games that emphasizes their goal-oriented nature. 
- According to Suits, a game is "the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles." 
- This definition highlights the idea that games involve a deliberate and voluntary effort to achieve a goal within a set of constraints.

---

## 6: Types of Games
- Suits distinguishes between two types of games: **finite** and **infinite**. 
- **Finite** games have a clear beginning and end and are played for the purpose of winning or losing. 
- **Infinite** games, on the other hand, have no fixed endpoint and are played for the sake of continuing the game.

## 7: The Value of Games
- One of the central arguments of 'The Grasshopper' is that games are valuable in themselves. 
- Suits argues that games allow us to experience a kind of freedom that is not available in other areas of life. 
- When we play a game, we are free to pursue a goal that is valuable in itself, without being constrained by external goals or pressures.

---

## 8: Criticisms
- Suits' theory of games has been the subject of some criticism. 
- Some have argued that his definition of games is too narrow, and excludes many activities that are commonly thought of as games. 
- Others have suggested that the lusory attitude is not unique to games, but can be found in other activities as well.

---

## 9: Impact
- Despite its critics, 'The Grasshopper' has had a significant impact on the philosophy of games. 
- It has influenced subsequent discussions of the nature of games, the value of play, and the relationship between games and work. 
- The book is now considered a classic in the field and is widely cited in discussions of game theory.

---

## 10: Conclusion
- In conclusion, Bernard Suits' book 'The Grasshopper' offers a unique and influential theory of games. 
- By emphasizing the importance of the lusory attitude and the value of games for their own sake, Suits has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the role that games and play can play in human life.
